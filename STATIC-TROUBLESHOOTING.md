# Why the Static Content Was Showing "Loading"

## The Problem

When you opened the HTML file directly in your browser (using `file://` protocol), the browser's CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy prevented the JavaScript from making API calls to external services like Open-Meteo. This is a security feature that blocks local files from accessing external APIs.

## The Solution

The static content needs to be served through an HTTP server, not opened directly as a file. The build script creates everything needed for this.

## How to Run the Static App

1. **Build the static version** (you already did this):

   ```bash
   ./build-static.sh
   ```

2. **Run the app** using one of these methods:

   **Method 1: Node.js server (Recommended)**

   ```bash
   ./run-static.sh
   ```

   Opens at: http://localhost:3000

   **Method 2: Python server**

   ```bash
   ./run-python-server.sh
   ```

   Opens at: http://localhost:8080

## What's Happening Now

- ✅ The static build is working correctly
- ✅ Weather data is being fetched from Open-Meteo API
- ✅ All 59 Colorado 14ers are displayed with current weather
- ✅ Search, sorting, and theming all work

## Key Files Created

- `run-static.sh` - Easy script to start the Node.js server
- `run-python-server.sh` - Alternative Python server option
- `build/` directory contains all static files ready for deployment

The app is now fully functional when served through an HTTP server!
