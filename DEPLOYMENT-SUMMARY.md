## 🚀 Deployment Options (Choose One)

### 1. Static Deployment (Recommended - Free & Fast)

**Best for**: Most users, no server maintenance, free hosting

```bash
# Build static version
./build-static.sh

# Deploy to Netlify (easiest)
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --dir=build --prod

# Or deploy to Vercel
npm install -g vercel
cd build && vercel --prod
```

**Pros**: Free, fast, no maintenance, global CDN, automatic SSL
**Cons**: Client-side only, API calls from browser

### 2. Full Node.js Server

**Best for**: Custom features, server-side caching, API control

```bash
# Deploy to Heroku
echo "web: node server.js" > Procfile
heroku create your-app-name
git push heroku main

# Or deploy to Railway
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway up
```

**Pros**: Full control, server-side processing, custom APIs
**Cons**: More expensive, requires maintenance

### 3. Docker Deployment

**Best for**: Scalable deployments, container orchestration

```bash
# Build and run locally
docker-compose up -d

# Deploy to any cloud provider
docker build -t 14er-weather .
docker run -p 3000:3000 14er-weather
```

**Pros**: Consistent environments, scalable, portable
**Cons**: More complex setup
