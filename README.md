## Hiking Condition Analysis

The app analyzes multiple weather factors to determine the best days for hiking 14ers:

### **Evaluation Criteria**

- **Temperature Range**: Ideal between 40-70¬∞F, penalties for extreme cold/heat
- **Precipitation**: Heavy penalties for rain/snow, bonus for dry conditions
- **Wind Speed**: Critical for high-altitude safety, dangerous above 40mph
- **Weather Conditions**: Severe penalties for thunderstorms, snow, heavy rain
- **Cloud Cover**: Better scores for clear skies and good visibility
- **Altitude-Specific**: Extra penalties for extreme conditions above 14,000ft

### **Hiking Scores**

- **Excellent (80-100)**: Perfect conditions for hiking
- **Good (65-79)**: Good day with proper preparation
- **Fair (45-64)**: Challenging conditions, experienced hikers only
- **Poor (25-44)**: Not recommended for hiking
- **Dangerous (0-24)**: Do not attempt - dangerous conditions

### **Safety Features**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Weather Warnings**: Alerts for dangerous conditions like thunderstorms, high winds
- ‚úÖ **Positive Indicators**: Highlights favorable conditions
- ü•æ **Best Day Badge**: Clearly marks the optimal hiking day for each mountain

## Weather Data Source

This app now uses **Open-Meteo** - a completely free weather API that requires no registration or API keys:

- ‚úÖ **100% Free** - No cost, no limits for personal use
- ‚úÖ **No Configuration** - Works immediately without setup
- ‚úÖ **High Quality Data** - European weather model data
- ‚úÖ **Mountain Weather** - Excellent for high-altitude locations

## Running the Static Version

After building the static version with `./build-static.sh`, you have several options:

### Option 1: Node.js Server (Recommended)

```bash
./run-static.sh
```

Then open http://localhost:3000

### Option 2: Python HTTP Server

```bash
./run-python-server.sh
```

Then open http://localhost:8080

### Option 3: Manual Server Start

```bash
cd build
npm install  # First time only
npm start    # Starts Node.js server on port 3000
```

**Important:** Don't open the HTML file directly in your browser using `file://` - this will show "Loading..." forever due to CORS restrictions. Always use a local HTTP server.
